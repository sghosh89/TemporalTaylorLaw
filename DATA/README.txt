The datafiles will come as arranged into 7 subfolders (for_BBS, for_BioTIME, for_BioTIMEx, for_RivFishTIME, for_insectRoel, 
for_swisslake, for_zoop_2014) as also shown here.

In the present analysis, we took a subset of the above dataset (i.e., 1,694 out of 2,668 communities) 
based on the following condition:
We considered the communities that had a minimum of 15 species which were monitored for at least 20 years. 
Metadata file for those 1,694 communities is provided as the csv file in "Results/gather_res/" folder.
